![Hello world](hello_world.png)

```rust
ui.window("Hello world")
    .size([300.0, 100.0], Condition::FirstUseEver)
    .build(|| {
        ui.text("Hello world!");
        ui.text("こんにちは世界！");
        ui.text("This...is...imgui-rs!");
        ui.separator();
        let mouse_pos = ui.io().mouse_pos;
        ui.text(format!(
            "Mouse Position: ({:.1},{:.1})",
            mouse_pos[0], mouse_pos[1]
        ));
    });
```

## Main library crates

- imgui: High-level safe API
- imgui-winit-support: Backend platform implementation that uses the `winit`
  crate (latest by default, but earlier versions are supported via feature flags)
- imgui-glow-renderer: Renderer implementation that uses the `imgui` crate
- imgui-glium-renderer: Renderer implementation that uses the `glium` crate
- imgui-sys: Low-level unsafe API (automatically generated)

Additionally, the following are no longer maintained, but might work still:

- imgui-gfx-renderer: Renderer implementation that uses the `gfx` crate (_not
  the new gfx-hal crate_)

## Features

- Bindings for Dear ImGui that can be used with safe Rust. Note: API coverage
  is not 100%, but will keep improving over time.
- Builder structs for use cases where the original C++ library uses optional
  function parameters
- Easy integration with `glow`/ `glium`
- Easy integration with winit (backend platform)
- Optional support for the freetype font rasterizer

## Minimum Support Rust Version (MSRV)

The MSRV for `imgui-rs` and all of the backend crates is **1.54**. We update our MSRV periodically, and issue a minor bump for it.

## Choosing a backend platform and a renderer

Almost every application that uses imgui-rs needs two additional components in
addition to the main `imgui` crate: a backend platform, and a renderer.

The backend platform is responsible for integrating imgui-rs with the operating
system and its window management. Its responsibilities include the following:

- Handling input events (e.g. keyboard, mouse) and updating imgui-rs state
  accordingly
- Passing information about the OS window (e.g. size, DPI factor) to imgui-rs
- Updating the OS-side mouse cursor when imgui-rs requests it

The renderer is responsible for taking generic, renderer-agnostic _draw lists_
generated by imgui-rs, and rendering them using some graphics API. Its
responsibilities include the following:

- Rendering using vertex/index buffers and command lists
- Handling of DPI factors and scissor rects
- Texture management

The most tested platform/renderer combination is `imgui-glium-renderer` +
`glium` + `imgui-winit-support` + `winit`, but this is not the only possible
combination. There's also `imgui-glow-renderer`, which will increasingly replace
`glium`, and you can find additional 3rd party crates that provide a wider
support for more libraries (e.g. raw OpenGL, SDL2). You can also write your own
support code if you have a more advanced use case, because **imgui-rs is not tied to any specific graphics / OS API**.

## Compiling and running the demos

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imgui-rs/imgui-rs
cd imgui-rs
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Main examples are located in the `imgui-examples` directory.

```bash
# At the reposity root
cd imgui-examples
cargo test

cargo run --example hello_world
cargo run --example test_window
cargo run --example test_window_impl
```

Examples for the gfx backend are under the imgui-gfx-examples directory.

```bash
cd imgui-gfx-examples
cargo test

cargo run --example gfx_hello_world
cargo run --example gfx_test_window
```

Note to Windows users: You will need to use the _MSVC ABI_ version of the Rust
compiler along with its associated
[dependencies](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/downloads.html#win-foot) to
build this libary and run the examples.

## How to contribute

1. Change or add something
2. Make sure you're using the latest stable Rust
3. Run rustfmt to guarantee code style conformance

   ```bash
   rustup component add rustfmt
   cargo fmt
   ```

4. Open a pull request in Github
