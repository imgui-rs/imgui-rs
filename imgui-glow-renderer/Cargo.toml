[features]
# Features here are used to opt-out of compiling code that depends on certain
# OpenGL features. If the features are enabled, the renderer will check that the
# feature is supported before attempting to use it. Only opt-out of any of these
# if you are certain you will only target platforms that lack the corresponding
# feature.
