//! This crate provides a winit-based backend platform for imgui-rs.
//!
//! A backend platform handles window/input device events and manages their
//! state.
//!
//! # Using the library
//!
//! There are five things you need to do to use this library correctly:
//!
//! 1. Initialize a `WinitPlatform` instance
//! 2. Attach it to a winit `Window`
//! 3. Pass events to the platform (every frame)
//! 4. Call frame preparation callback (every frame)
//! 5. Call render preparation callback (every frame)
//!
//! ## Complete example for winit 0.20+ (without a renderer)
//!
//! ```rust,no_run,ignore
//! # // TODO: Remove ignore when only one winit version is used
//! use imgui::Context;
//! use imgui_winit_support::{HiDpiMode, WinitPlatform};
//! use std::time::Instant;
//! use winit::event::{Event, WindowEvent};
//! use winit::event_loop::{ControlFlow, EventLoop};
//! use winit::window::{Window};
//!
//! let mut event_loop = EventLoop::new();
//! let mut window = Window::new(&event_loop).unwrap();
//!
//! let mut imgui = Context::create();
//! // configure imgui-rs Context if necessary
//!
//! let mut platform = WinitPlatform::init(&mut imgui); // step 1
//! platform.attach_window(imgui.io_mut(), &window, HiDpiMode::Default); // step 2
//!
//! let mut last_frame = Instant::now();
//! let mut run = true;
//! event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::NewEvents(_) => {
//!             // other application-specific logic
//!             last_frame = imgui.io_mut().update_delta_time(last_frame);
//!         },
//!         Event::MainEventsCleared => {
//!             // other application-specific logic
//!             platform.prepare_frame(imgui.io_mut(), &window) // step 4
//!                 .expect("Failed to prepare frame");
//!             window.request_redraw();
//!         }
//!         Event::RedrawRequested(_) => {
//!             let ui = imgui.frame();
//!             // application-specific rendering *under the UI*
//!
//!             // construct the UI
//!
//!             platform.prepare_render(&ui, &window); // step 5
//!             // render the UI with a renderer
//!             let draw_data = ui.render();
//!             // renderer.render(..., draw_data).expect("UI rendering failed");
//!
//!             // application-specific rendering *over the UI*
//!         },
//!         Event::WindowEvent { event: WindowEvent::CloseRequested, .. } => {
//!             *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit;
//!         }
//!         // other application-specific event handling
//!         event => {
//!             platform.handle_event(imgui.io_mut(), &window, &event); // step 3
//!             // other application-specific event handling
//!         }
//!     }
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! ## `winit` versions and features.
//!
//! This crate has several features which control the version of winit which is
//! used.
//!
//! The following versions are supported, controlled by the listed feature.
//!
//! - The `winit-26` feature uses winit versions compatible with `0.26`. This is
//!   on by default, so to use any other version you need to disable this crates
//!   default features.
//! - The `winit-25` feature supports winit versions `0.25`.
//! - The `winit-24` feature supports winit versions `0.24`.
//! - The `winit-23` feature uses winit versions compatible with `0.23`.
//! - The `winit-22` feature uses winit versions compatible with `0.22`.
//! - The `winit-20` feature should support winit either `0.20` or winit `0.21`.
//! - The `winit-19` feature should support winits older than `0.19` (possibly
//!   back to winit 0.16.*, but this isn't regularly tested and may not work).
//!
//! If multiple `winit-*` features are enabled, and it is a debug build (as
//! determined by `debug_assertions`), we will log a warning to stderr during
//! init. This can be disabled by either turning on the `no-warn-on-multiple`
//! feature, fixing the configuration, or disabling `debug_assertions`.
//!
//! Conversely, if no `winit-*` features are enabled, we will fail to compile.
//! This is not an issue generally, as by default we turn on `winit-26`.
//!
//! All of this is in attempt to preserve the additive nature of features (while
//! still helping users notice project configuration issues), however it's done
//! fairly weakly as our this crate's API isn't 100% identical across winit
//! versions.
//!
//! ### Using an older `winit` version
//!
//! To use an older version, you must configure `default-features = false` in
//! your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.imgui-winit-support]
//! version = "0.6"
//! features = ["winit-$YOUR_VERSION_HERE"]
//! default-features = false
//! ```
//!
//! ### Old `winit` compatibility
//!
//! No guarantee is made on how long this crate will support legacy versions of
//! `winit`, but we'll try to follow these rules:
//!
//! - Versions which are still in widespread use in the ecosystem will be
//!   supported while that is true (for example, 0.19 at the time of writing is
//!   quite old, but used by the most recent version of several popular crates).
//!
//! - Versions which are not a significant maintenance burden will be supported
//!   (for example, supporting versions older than winit 0.19 given that we
//!   support 0.19).
//!
//! - Explicitly removing support for a feature-indicated version will be
//!   considered a breaking change.
//!
//! - Changing the default feature to the new latest `winit` version is *not* a
//!   breaking change.
